The feasible solution exists and the implemented in the following solution (code).
The following solution satisfies all the constraints and conditions as mentions in the problem statement. 

Taking the csv file as input and then  implement the total state forecast by proportinate ratio. 

Then secondly individual zone forecast is implemented by the same proportinate ratio that satisfies the given constraints. 

In these the total capicity of zonal forecast is not exceeding the given constraints. 

At last the output is transferred into the output file as output.csv file.

Also all the detailed comments are mentioned into the code.
